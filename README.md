A Sentiment Analysis project that used an Amazon dataset from Kaggle (link further below) to analyse and assess the general polarity (positive or negative) sentiment of
a given Amazon review, using spacy and Textblob modules within Python. An incredibly useful tool when assessing how the product has been received by the general public.
